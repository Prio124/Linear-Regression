# Linear-Regressio

This tiny project is made for educational purposes. 

I want to do some practice using linear regression formulas and calculate other indicators like RSE,RSS, SE and the correlation between x and y.

I would also like to implement an import/export for different data sets (csv) and create random functions.

Finally, all the results are diplayed in a plot which is created using matplotlib.
